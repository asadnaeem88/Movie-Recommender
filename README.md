# Movie-Recommender
Recommendation systems have grown in popularity over the last few years. As we all know, recommendation algorithms have been a godsend in web-based buying and surfing portals. Despite the fact that a variety of movie recommendation systems have been suggested, the majority of these either cannot recommend a film to current clients efficiently or to new clients at all. The algorithm utilized determines the system's efficiency and accuracy. In this project, we will offer a system that will be able to recommend movies to both new and existing users. As a result, we will effectively design and study a system that combines Content-based and Collaborative-based recommendation systems.  In this solution, we will demonstrate how the outputs of algorithms are integrated to produce more accurate movie suggestions.
